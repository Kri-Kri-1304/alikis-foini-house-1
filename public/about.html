    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>The Christou family!</strong> Your hosts: Alice and Afxentis, we live in Larnaca, although we have the mountains in our veins...</p>

    <p>We were searching for a small but solid property, affordable, with plenty of tourist activities nearby so we could keep our 2 children entertained, good neighbours and friendly villagers — and we are blessed to have found our Foini escape...</p>

    <p>Every time we arrive at Foini, we get a full recharge from the air of the mountains, people, nature and we are captivated by the beauty of the untouched countryside...</p>

    <p>Exceptionally peaceful and ideal for up to 4 guests, small families or couples that just want their own space for a while.</p>

    <p>We have so much enjoyed welcoming guests and have been thrilled to know they have felt the peace and recharging of Foini and depart with such fond memories...</p>

    <p>We know that being here is our destiny and we hope you will decide to join us.</p>
