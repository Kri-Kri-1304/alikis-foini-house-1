        <p>Check‑in time is from <strong>13:00</strong> onwards, and check‑out time is maximum by <strong>11:00</strong>. We understand that travel plans may vary, and we are always happy to accommodate earlier check‑in and/or later check‑out whenever possible (and at no charge); however we can confirm this only two days before your scheduled arrival or departure, as it depends on the schedule of our cleaners plus the travel plans of our next guests.</p>
        <p><strong>Early Check‑in / Late Check‑out Options:</strong> If you require an early check‑in or late check‑out and prefer not to wait for confirmation two days before your stay, we offer the option to secure your desired time slot by booking the additional day(s) and paying the corresponding daily fee. This ensures flexibility and convenience for your travel plans while guaranteeing your preferred check‑in or check‑out time.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>50%</strong> deposit is required to secure any booking.</li>

        <p>Other than for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or misrepresentation, our total liability to you is limited to the value of the Booking and to the fullest extent permitted by law all warranties are excluded and in no circumstances will we be responsible for any indirect or special damages.</p>
        <p>We do not accept liability for any accident or loss from your car while on our premises, or the loss of valuables while left in the house.</p>
